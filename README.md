# Spotify Web API for Laravel

---
**This package is still under construction and not yet a Composer package.**

---

This package follows Spotify's [Web API docs](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) and depends on the [API Token Manager for Laravel](https://github.com/modelesque/laravel-api-token-manager). Currently, it can only be installed locally, and doing so will run a migration to create a `api_tokens` table in your database. How the package functions is talked about in detail [in this gist](https://gist.github.com/modelesque/9468e240ac86e4ef82817d884027e97d#file-emotionalists-code-walkthrough-02-backend-md).

More coming soon...
